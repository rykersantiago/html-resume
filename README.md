README
Hello, this is my first primary project using HTML and CSS. It's a simple and quite basic resume site using only HTML and CSS, and I'm hosting it on GITHUB for future reference. Of course, I do hope and expect my projects to be significantly better than this when the time comes, so best wishes to future me.

IMAGES
The pngegg image is the Mario star, used for the top container. There are two, and in the middle there should be the moonpng image. Then at the bottom of the top container is the citypng. 
There are then other SVGs, such as the phone-svgrepo-com svg used for the phone number part and the email-svgrepo-com for my email.

CONTACT
My contact is in the website, but I'll put here too just in case. EMail: zevisantiago@gmail.com and PH: 0412243051.
